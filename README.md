## About Tic Tac Toe

The game Tic Tac Toe is created with a 3 by 3 grid. There are two players and each player takes turns placing their marking in one grid spot. In this case, the first player places an X and the second a O. The goal of the game is to make a three in a row with your markings. A three in a row can be horizontal, diagonal, or vertical.
